<h1>About Binaryville</h1>
<p>On the edge of the world stands the progressive town of Binaryville, where technology is a way of life. The robots who
live, work, and play in Binaryville learn from an early age that magic is made simply by combining 0's and 1's. For the
Binaryville robots, every waking thought and every sleeping dream is consumed with unique permutationsâ€¦and endless
possibilities.</p>
